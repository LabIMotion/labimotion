## [1.4.0]
> 2024-08-22

* Features and enhancements:
  * **Preview image function for the “Upload” field type**: An image preview is provided once the uploaded file is an image. Furthermore, users can zoom in/out by changing the percentage, and the original file can be opened with one click. See the [idea](https://github.com/LabIMotion/labimotion/discussions/19) and a [visual demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzNT2NSk_wc&feature=youtu.be).
  * **Labeling feature**: Allows users to add custom labels to elements for better organization and categorization. This feature enhances searchability and management within the system. See the [idea](https://github.com/LabIMotion/labimotion/discussions/28) and a [visual demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geuMQzN91aQ&feature=youtu.be).
  * **Drag reactions to elements**: Users can now drag and drop reactions onto elements, making the interface more interactive and intuitive. Consequently, the Export/Import Collection function and Reporting function will also include reaction data. See the [idea](https://github.com/LabIMotion/labimotion/discussions/22) and a [visual demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oYkJaqhZPE).
  * **Change layer or field order via drag-and-drop**: Designers can rearrange layers or fields by simply dragging and dropping them into the desired order. This provides a more flexible and user-friendly way to manage data. A [visual demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4nMukebAyA) is available.
  * **Custom flow**: Enables users to record their steps/work and visualize them as a flow diagram. A [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6Q9sybhzmc) for your reference.
